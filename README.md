# omni_papr
Run omni.m, var_vs_papr.m and asymptotic.m to check the simulation results in our paper "Quasi-omnidirectional Beamforming for Uniform Rectangular Array".
# omni.m
To compare 3D beampatterns and CDFs of transmitted power and radiation power across the angular domain
# var_vs_papr.m
to show the tradeoffs of standard deviation of radiation power across the angular domain and the PAPR of transmitted power
# asymptotic.m
To verify the asymptotic analysis
# gen_qiao.m
To generate sequences by the literature "Broadbeam for massive MIMO systems"
# pgd_acc.m
Our algorithm to generate a beamforming matrix
# gen_angle_vec.m
To generate discretized angles for simulation
